# Explore and analyze time stamped data with Time Series Insights

## Lab Scenario

 Contoso's asset condition tracking revealed a spike in temperature for a specific asset, we want to find the root cause. We want to understand what happened: we correlate the IoT device's sensor data from transportation trucks and planes sensors. The temperature in one of the trucks rose and created the heat spike in one of the transport box equipped with an IoT device with temperature and humidity sensors. Your team will need to be able to explore data in near real time and perform root-cause analysis to help with improving delivery processes to ensure products are kept in the best condition.
 
 You will add Time Series Insights to the solution to quickly store, visualize, and query large amounts of time series data, that are generated by the IoT devices in the trucks, planes, and the transport boxes themselves to visualize changes over time.

## In This Lab

* Create an Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) environment
* Create IoT Hub and simulated device (using CLI)
* Connect to IoT Hub with Time Series Insights (TSI)
* Create and deploy TSI resources by using templates with Time Series Insights
