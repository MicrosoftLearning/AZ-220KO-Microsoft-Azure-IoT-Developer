# Connect Child IoT Device to IoT Edge Gateway

In this unit, you will configure the downstream, child IoT Devices to connect to IoT Hub using their configured Symmetric Keys. The devices will be configured to connect to IoT Hub and the parent IoT Edge Device using a Connection String that contains the Symmetric Key; in addition to the Gateway Hostname for the Parent IoT Edge Device.

The process to authenticate regular IoT devices to IoT Hub with symmetric keys also applies to downstream (or child / leaf) devices. The only difference is that you need to add a pointer to the Gateway Device to route the connection or, in offline scenarios, to handle the authentication on behalf of IoT Hub.

In a previous unit, you created the IoT Device Identities in Azure IoT Hub. You copied the **Connection String** for the IoT Device. Alternatively, the Connection String can be accessed with the Azure portal for the Device ID of the device within Azure IoT Hub.

1. Copy the `azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem` x.509 certificate file that was downloaded previously (when the IoT Edge Gateway was configured) to the `/LabFiles/ChildIoTDevice` directory where the source code for the Child IoT Device is located.

1. Open the `/LabFiles/ChildIoTDevice` directory within **Visual studio Code**.

1. Open the **ChildIoTDevice.cs** source code file.

1. Locate the declaration for the `s_connectionString` variable and replace the value placeholder with the **IoT Hub Connection String** for the **ChildDevice1** IoT Device.

1. Modify the **IoT Hub Connection String** to include the `GatewayHostName` property with the value set to the **Hostname** for the IoT Edge Gateway (`IoTEdgeGateway`) virtual machine.

    The Connection String will match the following format:

    ```text
    HostName=<iot-hub-name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=DownstreamDevice1;SharedAccessKey=<iot-device-key>;GatewayHostName=<iot-edge-gateway-hostname>
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

    - `<iot-hub-name>`: The **Name** of the **Azure IoT Hub**.
    - `<iot-device-key>`: The Primary or Secondary **Key** for the **ChildDevice1** IoT Device in IoT Hub.
    - `<iot-edge-gateway-hostname>`: Enter the **IP Address** for the **IoTEdgeGateway** virtual machine.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the **Terminal** window within Visual Studio Code.

1. Navigate the **Terminal** to the location of the `/LabFiles/ChildIoTDevice` directory.

1. Run the following command to build the code for the **ChildIoTDevice** simulated device, and execute it to start sending device telemetry:

    ```cmd/sh
    dotnet run
    ```

1. When the app installed the **x.509 certificate** on the local machine so it can use it to authenticate with the IoT Edge Gateway, it may prompt asking if you would like to install the certificate. Click **Yes** to allow it and continue.

1. Once the simulated device is running, the console output will display the events being sent to the Azure IoT Edge Gateway.

    The terminal output will look similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
    IoT Hub Quickstarts #1 - Simulated device. Ctrl-C to exit.

    ```

1. Leave the simulated device running while you move on to the next unit.
