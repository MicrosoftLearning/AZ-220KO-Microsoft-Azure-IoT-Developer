## Create a Custom IoT Central app

1. Navigate to [Azure IoT Central](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/?azure-portal=true). It's a good idea to bookmark this URL, as it's the home for all your IoT Central apps.

1. Click on **Build**, then **Custom apps**.

1. Your **Application name** can be any friendly name, such as "Refrigerated Trucks". However, the **URL** _must_ be unique, which is why you'll add a unique ID to the end of the URL for the app. For example, `refrigerated-trucks-<your id>`, replacing `<your id>` with some unique ID.

1. Leave the **Application template** as **Preview application**.

1. Select the free **7 day free trial** option. Seven days is plenty of time to complete the scenario.

1. Fill out your contact info, and click **Create**. Wait a few seconds whilst the app resource is built.

1. You should now see a **Dashboard** with a few default links.

The next time you visit your Azure central home page, select **My apps** in the left-hand menu, and an icon for your  **Refrigerated Trucks** app should appear.

You've now created the app. The next step is to specify a _device template_.
