# Connect Downstream Device to IoT Edge Gateway

In this unit, you will configure a pre-built Downstream Device to connect to the IoT Edge Gateway.

1. If necessary, log in to your Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.

    If you have more than one Azure account, be sure that you are logged in with the account that is tied to the subscription that you will be using for this course.

1. At the top of the Azure Portal click on the **Cloud Shell** icon to open up the **Azure Cloud Shell** within the Azure Portal. When the pane opens, choose the option for the **Bash** terminal within the Cloud Shell.

1. Within the **Cloud Shell**, run the following command to download the **root CA** x.509 certificate for the Azure IoT Edge Gateway (`AZ-220-VM-EDGEGW-{YOUR-ID}`) virtual machine.

    ```cmd/sh
    download certificates/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
    ```

    The Azure IoT Edge Gateway was configured (within the `/etc/iotedge/config.yaml` file) previously to use this **root CA** x.509 certificate for encrypting communications with any downstream devices connecting to the gateway. This x.509 certificate will need to be copied to the downstream devices so they can use it to encrypt communications with the gateway.

1. Copy the `azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem` x.509 certificate file to the `/LabFiles/DownstreamDevice` directory where the source code for the downstream IoT device is located.

1. Open the `/LabFiles/DownstreamDevice` directory within **Visual studio Code**.

1. Open the **SimulatedDevice.cs** source code file.

1. Locate the declaration for the `s_connectionString` variable and replace the value placeholder with the **IoT Hub Connection String** for the **DownstreamDevice1** IoT Device.

1. Modify the **IoT Hub Connection String** to include the `GatewayHostName` property with the value set to the full **DNS name** for the IoT Edge Gateway Device (`AZ-220-VM-EDGEGW`).

    The Connection String will match the following format:

    ```text
    HostName=<IoT-Hub-Name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=DownstreamDevice1;SharedAccessKey=<IoT-Device-Primary-Key>;GatewayHostName=<IoT-Edge-Device-DNS-Name>
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

    - `<IoT-Hub-Name>`: The Name of the Azure IoT Hub.
    - `<IoT-Device-Primary-Key>`: The Primary Key for the **DownstreamDevice1** IoT Device in Azure IoT Hub.
    - `<IoT-Edge-DNS-Name>`: The DNS name set for the **AZ-220-VM-EDGEGW**.

    The `s_connectionString` variable with the Connection String value will look similar to the following:

    ```csharp
    private readonly static string s_connectionString = "HostName=AZ-220-HUB-1119.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=DownstreamDevice1;SharedAccessKey=ygNT/WqWs2d8AbVD9NAlxcoSS2rr628fI7YLPzmBdgE=;GatewayHostName=AZ-220-VM-EDGEGW.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com";
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. Locate the **Main** method. This method contains the code that instantiates the `DeviceClient` using the configured Connection String, and specifies **MQTT** as the transport protocol to use for communicating with the Azure IoT Edge Gateway.

    ```csharps_deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(s_connectionString, TransportType.Mqtt);
    SendDeviceToCloudMessagesAsync();
    ```

    This method also executes the **InstallCACert** method which has some code to automatically install the **root CA** x.509 certiifcate to the local machine. And it executes the **SendDeviceToCloudMessagesAsync** method that sends event telemetry from the simulated device.

1. Locate the **SendDeviceToCloudMessagesAsync** method. This method contains the code that generates the simulated device telemetry, and sends the events to the IoT Edge Gateway.

1. Locate the **InstallCACert** and browse the code that installed the **root CA** x.509 certificate to the local machine certificate store.

1. Open a command-prompt / terminal and navigate to the location of the `/LabFiles/DownstreamDevice` directory.

1. Run the following command to build the code for the **DownstreamDevice1** simulated device, and execute it to start sending device telemetry:

    ```cmd/sh
    dotnet run
    ```

1. When the app installed the **x.509 certificate** on the local machine so it can use it to authenticate with the IoT Edge Gateway, it may prompt asking if you would like to install the certificate. Click **Yes** to allow it and continue.

1. Once the simulated device is running, the console output will display the events being sent to the Azure IoT Edge Gateway.

    The terminal output will look similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
    IoT Hub Quickstarts #1 - Simulated device. Ctrl-C to exit.

    ```

1. Leave the simulated device running while you move on to the next unit.
