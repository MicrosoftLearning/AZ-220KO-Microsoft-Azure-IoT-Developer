# Detect if your IoT Device was Tampered with Azure Security Center for IoT

## Lab Scenario

Contoso has built all their solutions with security in mind. However, they want to see how they can better get a unified view of security across all of their on-premises and cloud workloads, including their Azure IoT solutions. Plus, when onboarding new devices, we want to apply security policies across workloads (Leaf devices, Microsoft Edge devices, IoT Hub) to ensure compliance with security standards and improved security posture.

Contoso is adding a brand new assembly line outfitted with new IoT devices to help with the increasing shipping and packing demands for new orders. You want to ensure that any new devices are secured and also want to be able to see security recommendations to continue improving your solution's security in your full end-to-end IoT solution. You will start investigating using Azure IoT Center for IoT for your solution.

## In This Lab

We will be enabling the Azure Security Center for IoT to be able to see securely in our end to end IoT solutions. Tasks include:

1. Creating new IoT Hub
1. Enabling Azure Security Center for IoT
1. Create and Registering new Device
1. Create a Security Module Twin
1. Install C#-based Security Agent on a Linux Device
1. Configure Solution
