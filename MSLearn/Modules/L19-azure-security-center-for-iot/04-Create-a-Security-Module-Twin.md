# Create a Security Module Twin

Azure Security Center for IoT offers full integration with your existing IoT device management platform, enabling you to manage your device security status as well as make use of existing device control capabilities. Azure Security Center for IoT integration is achieved by making use of the IoT Hub twin mechanism.

Azure Security Center for IoT makes use of the module twin mechanism and maintains a security module twin named azureiotsecurity for each of your devices.

The security module twin holds all the information relevant to device security for each of your devices.

To make full use of Azure Security Center for IoT features, you'll need to create, configure and use these security module twins for your new IoT Edge device.

The security module twin **azureiotsecurity** can be created in two ways:

* [Module batch script](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security/tree/master/security_module_twin) - automatically creates module twin for new devices or devices without a module twin using the default configuration.
* Manually editing each module twin individually with specific configurations for each device.

In this task, you will be creating a security module twin manually.

1. Navigate to your new IoT device if you are not there already.
    1. On the Azure portal menu, click Dashboard and open yourÂ IoT Hub. You can also in the portal search bar type in your IoT Hub name and select your IoT Hub resource once it pops up.
    1. In your IoT Hub, locate **IoT devices** under **Explorers**.

1. Click on **vm-device01**.
1. Click on **+ Add Module Identity**.
1. In the Module Identity Name field, enter **azureiotsecurity**. Leave all over fields the same and click **Save**. You should now see **azureiotsecurity** under **Module Identities** for your device.

    > [!NOTE] The Module Identity must be called **azureiotsecurity** and not another unique name.

1. While you are viewing the **vm-device01** information, copy the device's **Primary Key** to use later.

    > [!NOTE] Make sure to copy the device's **Primary Key** and not the connection string.

1. Navigate back to your IoT Hub, click on **Overview**.  Copy your IoT Hub hostname.

    > [!NOTE] Example of what an IoT Hub hostname looks like: AZ-220-HUB-CAH102119.azure-devices.net
