# Sign Up For PowerBI

Power BI can be your personal data analysis and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations. Later on in this lab, you will visualize data using PowerBI. This article explains how to sign up for Power BI as an individual.

>**Note:** If you already have a PowerBI subscription, you can skip to the next step.

## Supported Email Addresses

Before you start the sign-up process, it's important to learn which types of email addresses that you can use to sign-up for Power BI:

* Power BI requires that you use a work or school email address to sign up. You can't sign up using email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.

* After you sign up, you can [invite guest users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b) to see your Power BI content with any email address, including personal accounts.

* You can sign-up for Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this requires a different process. For more info, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-govus-signup).

## Sign up for a Power BI Account

Follow these steps to sign up for a Power BI account. Once you complete this process you will have a Power BI (free) license which you can use to try Power BI on your own using My Workspace, consume content from a Power BI workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity or initiate an individual Power BI Pro Trial.
